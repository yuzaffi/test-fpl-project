# test-fpl-project

This is a first draft repo for my fpl project

I created an **XGBoost ML model to predict football players statistics**, to **predict a players gameweek points in FantasyPL**.

I then created an **algorithm that would calculate the optimal team** for a given number of gameweeks and formation.

I created the ML model after a lot of feature creation and manipulation, and hyperparamter optimisation. Each football position has its own model to adapt for underlying stats having different effects depending on where someone plays on the pitch.

The code above is only the script to run predictions, and not data preprocessing.
